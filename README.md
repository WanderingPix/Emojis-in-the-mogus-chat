# An among us mod which adds emojis to chat!

This mod is **CLIENT-SIDED** Meaning you can join people who don't have it! and they'll see chat as normal, while other users will see the emojis!

Works with everything and anything, vanilla, town of us, stellar roles, the other roles, and maybe even a toaster!

Don't expect me to update this joke of a mod
